Given an encrypted ciphertext and the specification of an encryption method (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère, Hill, etc.), recover the original plaintext without being given the encryption algorithm or decryption procedure.

Given a ciphertext and a plaintext-ciphertext example pair only, reverse-engineer the encryption transformation—without being given the algorithmic rule or key—and apply the inferred pattern to decrypt the target ciphertext.

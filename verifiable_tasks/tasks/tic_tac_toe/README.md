# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a simple and classic two-player game played on a 3Ã—3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to place three of your marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns. One plays as `X`, the other as `O`.
- Players can place their mark in any empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

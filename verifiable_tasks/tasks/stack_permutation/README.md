# Puzzle Type & Task Name  
**Puzzle Type**: Sequential Puzzle  
**Task Name**: stack_permutation 

## Task Overview  
Stack permutation is a permutation problem related to stacks (a last-in, first-out data structure). Given an input sequence, the goal is to generate different output sequences using stack operations (push and pop). A sequence is called a valid stack permutation if it can be obtained through stack operations.

Given a sequence of natural numbers, such as [1, 2, 3, 4], we want to know if a particular output sequence can be obtained through stack operations. The stack operations include:

1. Push: Add numbers from the input sequence to the stack in order.
2. Pop: Remove elements from the top of the stack and add them to the output sequence.

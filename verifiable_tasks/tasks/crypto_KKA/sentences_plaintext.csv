15476,It is not a good idea,16
15478,Yes you should mention it,21

15491,I have had the same problem,22
15493,It depends on what they are evaluating and how,38
15494,You have answered your own question,30
15495,This is probably not a good idea but I will suggest it anyhow,49
15496,My recommendation is not to say anything and do the best you can,52
15497,I have the same situation and have traveled extensively,47
15498,You are right on the mark,20
15499,This is a part answer to your question,31
15500,You can still use it for practice,27
15501,It depends on what you want to be able to do,34
15502,You are not required to file a tax return in Canada if you have no taxable income,65

15504,The best thing to do is to overcome the fussiness,40
15505,It depends on the sauce and the result you want,38
15506,You have to do what is right for you,28
15507,No it makes no difference,21
15508,I think it is okay to ask the question,30
15509,Yes you can do exactly what you want to do,33
15510,You should prime it first,21
15511,I guess it depends on the nature of your contract,40
15512,Personally I would say not unless it suits you,38

15527,It depends on how the term is used I think,33
15528,There are a couple things you can try,30
15529,The more you sweat the faster you will burn calories and fat,49
15530,You pretty much answered your own question,36
15531,Yes although they can be a bit sour,28
15532,It is up to you whether you want to do that,33
15533,It is difficult if not impossible to give a complete answer to this question,63
15534,This gives you the opportunity to make your case that you really do have expertise in XXX,73
15535,You work on it slowly,17
15536,Yes it is hard to publish in a peer reviewed journal,42
15537,You do not need a transit visa but to enter Zurich you will need a visa,56
15538,I think this is one of those things where you are just out of luck,52

15540,I have the same problem,19
15541,I have the exact same problem,24
15542,Nope that will not work,19
15543,The best thing you can do is find something else interesting to do while you wait on hold,72
15544,Personally when I was in a similar situation I sent the couple a card and a gift,64
15545,You have to find out what works for you,31

15553,Not a good idea,12
15554,I have exactly the same problem,26
15555,You should never do it,18

15558,It depends on what and where you are going to do,38
15559,There are a few reasons that paint wrinkles,36
15560,Think of it this way,16

15563,This will depend on the university,29
15564,I had this same situation,21
15565,There is no code telling you that you cannot do this,42
15566,Yes you should talk to your professor,31

15569,I agree with the previous comments,29
15570,If the answer to any of these questions is yes a PhD may be worthwhile for you,62

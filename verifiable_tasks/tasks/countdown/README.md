# Countdown

**Countdown** is a classic number and word puzzle game inspired by the popular British TV show. It consists of two main challenges: the **Letters Round** and the **Numbers Round**, testing both vocabulary and arithmetic skills.

## Game Modes

### Letters Round
- Players select a mix of vowels and consonants (typically 9 letters total).
- The goal is to create the longest valid English word possible using those letters.
- Words must be formed using each letter at most once.

### Numbers Round
- Players choose a set of numbers (a mix of large and small numbers).
- A random target number is generated (between 100 and 999).
- Using basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷), players must reach the target or get as close as possible using the selected numbers.

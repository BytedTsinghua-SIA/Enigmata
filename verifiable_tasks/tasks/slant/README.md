# Slant

Slant, also known as Gokigen Naname, is a logic puzzle played on a grid where numbers are placed at the intersections. The goal is to draw a diagonal line (either "/" or "") in each cell so that the number at each intersection matches the number of lines extending from it, and no closed loops are formed by the diagonals.

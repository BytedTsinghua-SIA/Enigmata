We introduce **Enigmata**, the *first* comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills, which integrates seamlessly with reinforcement learning using verifiable rule-based rewards. 

**Enigmata-Data** includes *36 tasks across 7 categories*, each with: 1) a *generator* that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty, and 2) a rule-based *verifier* for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration.
We further propose **Enigmata-Eval**, a rigorous benchmark for assessing puzzle reasoning abilities and guiding research on generalizable reasoning models. 

**Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata**, trained with RLVR, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI, and ARC-AGI 2. It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multitasking trade-off.

When trained on **larger models like [Seed1.5-Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13914)** (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), **puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks** such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata.

***We hope Enigmata serves as a solid foundation for the community to push forth the research on reasoning models!***

## üß© Enigmata-Data: Synthetic Verifiable Puzzle Generation

### üîç Dataset Overview
Enigmata-Data comprises *36 distinct task* types spanning *7 categories* of logical reasoning puzzles. Each task is built with two core components:

- **Generator**: Produces *unlimited* puzzle instances with precisely controllable difficulty parameters
- **Verifier**: Provides *automatic*, *rule-based* solution validation for reliable evaluation

For comprehensive details on each task, please refer to our [task documentation](verifiable_tasks/README.md).

The generator-verifier design yields three key benefits:

- **Unlimited Self-Verifying Data**: It can generate an unlimited supply of self-verifying puzzle prompts, which plug seamlessly into the RLVR framework and support long chain-of-thought training.  

- **Controlled Difficulty**: Programmatic difficulty control allows researchers to mix puzzles in desired difficulty ratios and to conduct fine-grained experiments on how curriculum design influences reinforcement learning.  

- **Flexible Task Sampling**: Generators can emit arbitrary sample counts per task, enabling studies of task balancing and cross-task generalization.

### üèÉ Generating Puzzle Data

Will be released soon.

### üìä Benchmark Overview

Enigmata-Eval is a comprehensive benchmark containing 4,758 puzzle instances across Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels. Each task provides 50 instances per difficulty level where possible, with strict train-eval separation to prevent data leakage.

### üßê Quick Evaluation

Place your model's predictions of the tasks in the `output` column of `result.parquet` correspondingly, then evaluate model solutions across all tasks with:

```bash
# Run comprehensive evaluation
python test_eval.py --input result.parquet

```

The evaluation uses task-specific verifiers for automated solution validation.



## ü§ñ Enigmata-Model: The Training Recipe

Developing advanced logical reasoning in language models requires a carefully structured training approach. We develop **Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata** through a two-stage training process that systematically builds logical reasoning capabilities while maintaining generalization across domains: 
- **Stage 1: Rejection Fine-tuning (RFT)** to establish foundational reasoning patterns
- **Stage 2: Multi-task RL with Verifiable Rewards** to develop general reasoning skills that transfer across diverse problem domains

### üëÄ Performance Results


Our trained model **Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata** demonstrates superior performance across puzzle reasoning benchmarks and maintains strong mathematical reasoning capabilities.

On Enigmata-Eval, our Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata model excels in *Crypto*, *Arithmetic*, and *Logic* tasks, indicating strong rule-based reasoning. It also performs competitively in search tasks, though spatial and sequential categories remain challenging.

### üåü Generalization with Scaling: Free Lunch from Enigmata

Incorporating the **Enigmata-Data** synthetic puzzle dataset into large-scale model training, e.g., [Seed1.5-Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13914) (20B/200B), surprisingly improving performance on challenging benchmarks like AIME and GPQA Diamond. This demonstrates a **generalization benefit** for advanced reasoning models.
